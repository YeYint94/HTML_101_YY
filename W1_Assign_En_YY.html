    <h4>Introduction of the EIA System</h4>
    <p>
        Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a process and management tool for both planning and decision making, which assists to identify, predict, and evaluate the foreseeable environmental and social impacts caused by the proposed project, during the preparation, construction, operation, decommissioning, 
        closure and post-closure phases. EIA aims to harmonize the development activities with the environment and society. <br> The EIA system is one of the effective measures to fulfill Section 45 and 390 of the <a href="https://myanmar-law-library.org/law-library/laws-and-regulations/constitutions/2008-constitution.html">Constitution of the Republic of Union Myanmar</a>, 
        which requires that the State is; the Union shall protect and conserve natural environment (Section 45), and every citizen has the duty to assist the Union in carrying out (b) environmental conservation (Section 390). <br> For more information, click <a href="http://13.213.169.7/introduction-of-the-eia-system-in-myanmar/">here</a>
